###Computer open laboratory of Tongji University
The computer open laboratory of Tongji University is a virtual organization responsible for the development and operation of Como component technology. Its predecessor is the basic software engineering center of Tongji University（ https://gitee.com/tjopenlab/tjopenlab_web/blob/master/System_Software_Engineering_Centre_of_Tongji_University.md )。
C/c++ is the foundation of many program development environments, and these program development environments directly affect the ecology of software developed based on them. The c++ component model has experienced two major development stages. The stage technology led by Professor Chen Rong is named "car component technology", and the stage technology led by Dr. Cao Jing is named "Como c++ component technology".
Car technology is based on the [elastos operating system] hosted by Professor Chen Rong（ https://gitee.com/tjopenlab/openElastos ）So it has a certain degree of coupling with Elastos, which is a brand-new operating system with a different style from Linux. The Como c++ component technology led by Dr. Cao Jing emphasizes that it has nothing to do with the specific operating system and emphasizes the programming technology. Its development environment is Linux. Considering the difficulty of pushing an operating system, we generally start from Como, which has a relatively single technical architecture.
Como technology is derived from car component technology and Elastos Operating System.
The author of Como participated in the research and development of car component technology and Elastos Operating System, and was deeply influenced by Professor Chen Rong's technical concept.
Professor Chen Rong has long found that c++ language can not meet the needs of software as a service (SaaS). This problem is becoming more and more obvious in the era of mobile Internet and cloud services, so that although c++ language has the advantages of high performance and resource saving, it still quickly lost its leading position in the field of application development and was replaced by Java. From the technical point of view, we believe that the main reasons are: (1) c++ language lacks good decoupling ability; (2) C++ language does not support reflection; (3) C++ language does not have a class library built under a unified inheritance system.
The goal of car component technology is to solve the above problems, so that c++ language can become one of the mainstream languages of application development in the new era. Elastos Operating system is an attempt to develop application framework using car component technology.
In the process of participating in the research and development of Elastos Operating System, the author found some defects in the design and implementation of car component technology. After leaving the Elastos R &amp; D team, the author tried to further improve the c++ component technology according to his own ideas, thus creating the Como project.
